# HTP_slurm_generator_scripts
Set of scripts for generating bash files for use with slurm


##**snippy_pipeline_sbatch_local**
Python script to generate snippy commands for local fastq files which can then be used with slurm
<br>
Need to supply a tab delimited file with the required information and you can see an example of this in examples/snippy_pipeline_sbatch_local.txt
The file locations would need to be changed to match your system. The default behaviour of this tools is to remover interim files generated by snippy, if this is not desirable then you will need to use the --nocleanup flag

## **snippy_pipeline_sbatch_sra**
Python script to generate snippy commands for remote SRA fastq data which can then be used with slurm
<br>
Need to supply a tab delimited file with the required information and you can see an example of this in examples/snippy_pipeline_sbatch_sra.txt
The file locations would need to be changed to match your system. The default behaviour of this tools is to remover interim files generated by snippy as well as to delete downloaded fastq, if this is not desirable then you will need to use the --nocleanup flag
